  "about": {
    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "Software engineer with 3 years at Amazon, mostly building internal tools for product teams. I've worked across the stack - React frontends, Java backends, AWS infrastructure - and I'm good at jumping into unfamiliar codebases and figuring things out quickly. I like projects where I can solve actual problems, not just implement specs someone handed me. Outside of work: overpriced coffee, bouldering, running (did a half marathon once, never again), crochet and other tech stereotype may apply. Based in Vancouver, BC, open to remote or relocating."
